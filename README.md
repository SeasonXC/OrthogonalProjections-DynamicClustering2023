# OrthogonalProjections-DynamicClustering2023

## Description
This repository contains the materials for the "Orthogonal Projections and Dynamic Clustering" project, part of the "ANALYSE DE DONNÃ‰ES - MAD - ENSIIE" program. It focuses on advanced statistical and data analysis techniques, specifically orthogonal projections and dynamic clustering methods, including generalized k-means algorithms.

## Features
- Implementation of orthogonal projection of a point onto a line and the calculation of distances.
- Extension of the algorithm for multiple lines.
- Development of a generalized k-means algorithm in R.
- Application of the algorithm to the Iris dataset and comparison with standard k-means.
- Visualization and simulation tools for data analysis.
